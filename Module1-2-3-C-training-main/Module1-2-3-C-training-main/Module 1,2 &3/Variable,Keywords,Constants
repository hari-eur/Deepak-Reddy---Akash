#Write simple C programs for each - Variable,keywords,Constants along with your comments of understanding of the differences.

#Try to find the output of below program with your comments:

const int x = 8;
x =9;

#include<stdio.h>

    int a = 10;                             //int is a 2 or 4 bytes datatype

    char ch = 'a';                          //char is of 1 byte

    double d = 98;                          //double is of 8 bytes
    printf("the double value is %lf\n",d);
    int t = a+10;                           /*here t is a variable which is goin to hold the value of operation "a+10"*/
    printf("the value of t = %d\n",t);
    const int x = 8;
   // x = 9;
    /*printf("the value of x = %d\n",x); will raise an error because the keyword const makes variable as an read only variable*/
    /*the datatypes are keywords,the alphabets used to store the values are variables and the numerical literals are constants*/
    return 0;
}

/*output
the integer value is 10
the float value is 12.500000
the character value is a
the double value is 98.000000
the value of t = 20
