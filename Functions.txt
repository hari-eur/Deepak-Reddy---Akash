1.Write a sample program to implement call back function with your comments of understanding.
/*code*/
#include<stdio.h>
int wish1()
{
    int  a = 10;
    int b = 17;
    return a+b;
}
/*callback function*/
void callwish(int (*x)())
{
    printf("the sum of 2 numbers 10 and 17 is as below:\n");
    int val = (*x)();
    printf("%d",val);
}
int main()
{
    callwish(&wish1);
    return 0;
}
/*output
the sum of 2 numbers 10 and 17 is as below:
27
*/

2.Write a sample program for call by value and call by address and state the differences with your comments of understanding.
/*code*/
#include<stdio.h>
void callbyvalue(int a);
void callbyaddress(int *a);
int main()
{
    int a = 5;
    //for call by value
    printf("for call by value:\n");
    printf("Before passing to function a = %d\n",a);
    callbyvalue(a);
    printf("After passing to function a = %d\n",a);
    //for call by address
    printf("for call by address\n");
    printf("Before passing to function a = %d\n",a);
    callbyaddress(&a);//here the address is passed as argument
    printf("After passing to function a = %d\n",a);
    return 0;
}
void callbyvalue(int a)
{
    a = a*2;
    printf("In call by value function a=%d\n",a);
    /*here actual argument is  passed as an formal argument and any changes made to formal argumemt cant affect the actual argument*/
}
void callbyaddress(int *a)
{
    *a = *a*2;
    printf("In call by address function a = %d\n",*a);
    /*here actual argument address is  passed as an formal argument and any changes made to formal argumemt can affect the actual argument*/
}
/*output:
for call by value:
Before passing to function a = 5
In call by value function a=10
After passing to function a = 5
for call by address
Before passing to function a = 5
In call by address function a = 10
After passing to function a = 10
*/

3.Write a function which gets an array and returns address of second largest number in an array.
/*code*/
#include<stdio.h>
void retaddr(int a[]);
int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int a[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d",&a[i]);
    }
    retaddr(a);
    return 0;
}
void retaddr(int a[])
{
    int l = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);
    for(int i=0;i<l;i++)
    {
        for(int j=i+1;j<l;j++)
        {
            if(a[i]<a[j])
            {
                int  temp = a[i];
                a[i] = a[j];
                a[j] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
    printf("the second largest element is %d and its address is %p",a[1],&a[1]);
}
/*output:
5
8 7 6 2 5
the second largest element is 7 and its address is 0x7fff0cda8764
*/


4.Write a program to state difference between normal function and inline function.


5.Try to implement your own printf function.
